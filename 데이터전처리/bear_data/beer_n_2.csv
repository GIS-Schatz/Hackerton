I rated 0 for everything except for overall impression because this has no taste to speak off. It's just clean-tasting water. Great with sushi, but not good for much else.

A great beer that is always available at your local Japanese restaurant.  This is also a great party beer, as most people have not tried it, and is very agreeable to most people.

Crisp, and refreshing, but with not much flavor.  Perfect with Sushi becaese of those reasons.  Does not overpower the subtle flavor of the fish but cools off the Wasabi.

Testament to Japanese quality control offers little in flavor. Clean, crisp, clear, a little hop, no aftertaste. Lively carbonation

Not a fantastic beer, but quite a thirst quencher.  light head, crisp and just slightly hoppy.  A good dinner beer, in my opinion.

Draft at the Bangkok airport.  Golden colour.  Dull, grainy aroma.  Fairly dry, slightly appley.  Harsh fizz on the back of the tongue.  Bland, but at least clean.

Adequate, got it as a gift? Not crazy about dry beers. Some nose and a bit of hops, but to my palate, quite forgetable.
