Bottle.  Not really premium.  Yellow with no head.  Hayey aroma with maize field.  Flavour is a little hop, a little maize, a little malt.  Tart finish.  Doesn’t really go anywhere.

Different from German or Belgium style, sweet aroma, medium body, lively on palate.  Good beer, what you would imagine an Italian beer to be like, like a felini film.

White frothy head that quickly fades away and no lacing.  Pale yellow and a great deal of carbonation.  Not much flavor but not horrible.  A slight very short lasting bitterness.

A reasonable lager. Decent hop character but can taste a little skunky. Pasta fodder.

Golden coloured. This beer is dominated by two things: Carbonation and water. Enough said.

It would taste good when in Rome with the whole atmosphere, but in Australia it is fizzy yellow beer with a sweet tatse.
