Been to Singapore, but I’ve never tried their beer, so Tiger it was.  Pretty plain beer, similar to many North American beers.  It’s a good beer, but far from anything special.

A lager with a fairly frothy head and good carbonation.  The beer is pleasant, but the overall effect is spoilt by a dusty aroma.

Yellow, generic looking.  Nose is almost non-existent, with slight malt.  Taste is quite hoppy though.  Actually sharp and bitter.  Much better than I expected.

Pale yellow.  Odd esters in the nose - pear, green apple - always a sign of a failed lager.  Light and watery, with some slight fusel influence.  Unclean, hopless, a total drain pour.
