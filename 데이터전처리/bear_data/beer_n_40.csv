I prefer this to the supposed ""draught"" version of Guinness.  Its a shame that it is pastuerised nowdays.  Try the Foreign Extra Stout for a REAL treat!

I too prefer the draught version (nitro can incl.)- but still the original is very, very good! Try it with bacon and eggs - makes you want to eat breakfast all day.

As a dry stout, it's not that bad. However in comparison to either the widget or draught varieties, it doesn't stack up. (6.0% abv in Australia by the way)

I prefer this to those nitro draught cans, has a pleasant almost coffee like taste and a dark distinctive colour.

Brewed under licence in Australia by the Evil Empire itself, C.U.B. It's horrible. Fizzy, with a head full of big bubbles that disappear straight away (like coke). Syrupy and thin at the…

very original beer, not really anything like it. Takes a little getting used to. OK beer, but i think prefer the draught version.
