Pours a light golden color, nice white head that hangs around surprisingly long. Nose of Saaz hops, grassy. Considering it’s German heritage, it’s a decent Pils.

It looks like water, smells like water, tastes like water, and even feels like water. Hell, this is either the blandest beer or the best water - not sure which.

Light yellow pour with a fizzy head.  Very light sweet malt aroma and flavor.  Perhaps the reason they mention the Laoshan is that it is the main flavor element.

This is the worst beer I’ve ever tasted.  Sour and bitter, with too much carbonation.  My friend described it as ""skunk pee"", and I totally agree.  I would prefer Bud to this, and I hate Bud.

Very crisp palate, noble hop nose, long, bitter-balanced finish. I like this beer. Its not Pilsner Urquell, but I'd take it over Heiney or Stella anyday.

Typical Asian lager beer.  Light, watery, a little skunky.  Refreshing with hot Chinese or Thai food.  Good lawnmower beer.  Crisp and light.

I had this at a chinese restaurant in Paris, France.  It was clean and refreshing, but not my favorite by all means.  Seemed to fit the meal though, which was nice.
