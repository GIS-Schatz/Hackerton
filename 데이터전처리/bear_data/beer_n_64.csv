A bit smoother and less skunky than Heineken and Grolsch, which it has a lot in common with, but it’s still not my favorte kind of beer.  It’s not bad when you’re thirsty, though.

A pretty standard mass-market import lager. Very sweet malt with a little bit of apple. Thin mouthfeel. Finish is a little earthy, but doesn’t really change the bland profile.
