I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly suprised.  Yes it is watery with no head.  Yes the taste is rather bland with overtones of corn, but still not too bad.

An orange beer with a disappearing white head. Both the aroma and flavor is sour from the use of brewing cereal and the body is thin. A poor International Lager.
